## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- WhatsApp Web access
- Active internet connection
- Google Chrome browser (required by PyWhatKit)

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eng-Mohamed-Ezzat/WhatsApp-Bulk-Sender.git
cd WhatsApp-Bulk-Sender
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not:*

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# For macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install python-tk
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python whatsapp_sender_gui.py
```

## 📖 Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images

Place your images in the **same folder** as the Python script with the following naming format:

```
<phone_number>_<caption>.<extension>
```

**Examples:**
```
+201234567890_Hello from Python!.jpg
+447700900123_Check out this amazing product.png
+919876543210_Happy Birthday!.jpeg
```

### Step 2: File Naming Rules

- ✅ **Phone Number**: Include country code (e.g., +20, +44, +91)
- ✅ **Underscore**: Separate phone number and caption with `_`
- ✅ **Caption**: Your message text
- ✅ **Extension**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, or .bmp

**Valid Examples:**
- `+201062048212_Welcome to our service.jpg`
- `+447700900000_Special discount just for you.png`
- `+919876543210_Your order has been shipped.jpeg`

**Invalid Examples:**
- ❌ `201234567890.jpg` (missing caption)
- ❌ `phone_message.jpg` (no valid phone number)
- ❌ `+20123456789_message.txt` (wrong file format)

### Step 3: Launch and Send

1. Run the application
2. The app will automatically scan for images
3. Review the file list in the activity log
4. Click **"▶️ Start Sending"** to begin
5. The first message will open WhatsApp Web (scan QR code if needed)
6. Messages will be sent automatically with delays
7. Click **"⏹️ Stop"** to halt the process anytime

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can modify these settings in the code:

```python
self.wait_time = 15          # Seconds to wait before sending (for WhatsApp Web to load)
self.tab_close = True        # Close browser tab after sending
delay = rd.randint(5, 10)    # Random delay between messages (5-10 seconds)
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Scan**: Application scans the folder for image files
2. **Parse**: Extracts phone numbers and captions from filenames
3. **Queue**: Prepares the sending queue
4. **Send**: Uses PyWhatKit to open WhatsApp Web and send messages
5. **Delay**: Waits randomly between messages to avoid detection
6. **Log**: Records all activities in real-time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Tkinter** - GUI framework
- **PyWhatKit** - WhatsApp automation library
- **Threading** - Background task execution
- **Webbrowser** - Opening web links

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### First Run
- On first message, WhatsApp Web will open
- You need to scan the QR code with your phone
- Keep WhatsApp Web logged in for automatic sending

### Rate Limiting
- WhatsApp may block your number if you send too many messages
- The app includes random delays to minimize this risk
- Start with a small batch to test

### Best Practices
- ✅ Test with your own number first
- ✅ Use meaningful, non-spammy messages
- ✅ Don't send to people who didn't consent
- ✅ Keep delays between messages (5-10 seconds minimum)
- ✅ Send in small batches (10-20 messages at a time)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No images found"
**Solution**: Make sure image files are in the same folder as the script and follow the naming format

### Issue: WhatsApp Web doesn't open
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure Chrome is installed

### Issue: Messages not sending
**Solution**: 
- Verify phone numbers include country codes
- Check if WhatsApp Web is logged in
- Increase `wait_time` value for slower connections

### Issue: Application freezes
**Solution**: The app uses threading, but if it freezes, restart and try with fewer images
